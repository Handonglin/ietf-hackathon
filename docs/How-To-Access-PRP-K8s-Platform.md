How to Access and Use the PRP Kubernetes Platform
=================================================

## Platform Access

1. Contact the administrator (Jensen <mailto:jingxuan.n.zhang@gmail.com>) and
   send out the email address via that you want to log in the platform.
   (Check [issue#1](https://github.com/openalto/ietf-hackathon/issues/1))

   Note: The platform uses [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/) to do the
   authorization. Therefore, you should provide your **institutional email**, or
   your **ORCID**, **GitHub**, **Google**, or **Microsoft** account.

2. Once you received the approval, you can sign up a new account on
   the JupterHub (<https://alto.nrp-nautilus.io/>) using the email address that
   you sent out at the last step.

3. Log in the JupterHub (<https://alto.nrp-nautilus.io/>) and start a terminal
   or Jupter Notebook to access the kubernetes cluster.
